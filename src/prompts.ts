## Instructions for you

I would like you to summarize the diff within 50 words.
`
  triageFileDiff = `Below the summary, I would also like you to triage the diff as \`NEEDS_REVIEW\` or 
\`APPROVED\` based on the following criteria:

- If the diff involves any modifications to the logic or functionality, even if they 
  seem minor, triage it as \`NEEDS_REVIEW\`. This includes changes to control structures, 
  function calls, or variable assignments that might impact the behavior of the code.
- If the diff only contains very minor changes that don't affect the code logic, such as 
  fixing typos, formatting, or renaming variables for clarity, triage it as \`APPROVED\`.

Please evaluate the diff thoroughly and take into account factors such as the number of 
lines changed, the potential impact on the overall system, and the likelihood of 
introducing new bugs or security vulnerabilities. 
When in doubt, always err on the side of caution and triage the diff as \`NEEDS_REVIEW\`.

You must follow the format below strictly for triaging the diff and 
do not add any additional text in your response:
[TRIAGE]: <NEEDS_REVIEW or APPROVED>
`
  summarizeChangesets = `Provided below are changesets in this pull request. Changesets 
are in chronlogical order and new changesets are appended to the
end of the list. The format consists of filename(s) and the summary 
of changes for those files. There is a separator between each changeset.
Your task is to de-deduplicate and group together files with
related/similar changes into a single changeset. Respond with the updated 
changesets using the same format as the input.

  summarizePrefix = `Here is the summary of changes you have generated for files:

`

  summarizeShort = `Your task is to provide a concise summary of the changes 
and the goal of this PR. This summary will be used as a prompt while reviewing each 
file and must be very clear for the AI bot to understand. The summary should not 
exceed 250 words.

## How to parse the changes

The format for changes provided below consists of multiple change 
sections, each containing a new hunk (annotated with line numbers), 
an old hunk, and optionally, existing comment chains. The line number annotation on each line in the new 
hunk is of the format \`<line_number><colon><whitespace>\`.

### Format for changes

  ---new_hunk---
  \`\`\`
  <new hunk annotated with line numbers>
  \`\`\`

  ---old_hunk---
  \`\`\`
  <old hunk that was replaced by the new hunk above>
  \`\`\`

  ---comment_chains---
  \`\`\`
  <comment chains>
  \`\`\`

  ---end_change_section---
  ...

### Response format expected

  <start_line_number>-<end_line_number>:
  <review comment>
  ---
  <start_line_number>-<end_line_number>:
  <review comment>
  \`\`\`suggestion
  <code/text that replaces everything between start_line_number and end_line_number>
  \`\`\`
  ---
  <start_line_number>-<end_line_number>:
  <review comment>
  \`\`\`<language>
  <new code snippet>
  \`\`\`

  ...

## Example

### Example changes

  ---new_hunk---
  1: def add(x, y):
  2:     z = x+y
  3:     retrn z
  4:
  5: def multiply(x, y):
  6:     return x * y
  
  ---old_hunk---
  def add(x, y):
      return x + y

### Example response

  1-3:
  There's a typo in the return statement.
  \`\`\`suggestion
  def add(x, y):
      z = x + y
      return z

  5-6:
  LGTM!
